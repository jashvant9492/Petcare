Description
The project aims to develop "CatCare," a mobile application connecting Bangalore cat owners with trusted, local pet sitters, offering affordable, cat-specific care through a freemium model. 
The app addresses pain points like trust, affordability, and availability, targeting 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) in Year 1. 
Using low-code platforms (Bubble, Firebase, Google Cloud Dialogflow), it minimizes development costs (~INR 23 lakh) while ensuring hyper-local accessibility (85% bookings within 5 km) and scalability. 
The launch is planned for Q3 2025, aligning with peak travel seasons.
