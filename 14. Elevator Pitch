The elevator pitch is crafted to address Bengaluru’s pet sitting market, valued as part of India’s USD 115.7 million industry with a 16.4% CAGR (Grand View Research). 
CatCare targets ~340,000 cat-owning households, leveraging a freemium model to drive adoption (5,000 MAU by Q3 2026) and differentiate from competitors like PetBacker (INR 500–1,500/visit, 20% commission) and Crazycatlife (8-cat limit, no app).
