# CatCare Pet Care Application

## Project Overview

**CatCare** is a mobile application (iOS/Android) designed for cat-only pet care in Bengaluru, India, offering pet sitting, grooming, and telehealth consults. Launched in October 2025, CatCare targets Bengaluru’s ~340,000 cat-owning households, part of India’s USD 253.6 million pet sitting market by 2030 ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/horizon/outlook/pet-sitting-market/india)). With a freemium model (INR 200–350/visit, INR 800–1,200/month premium), it emphasizes hyper-local accessibility, trust, and cat-specific care, differentiating from competitors like PetBacker (INR 500–1,500/visit).

The app supports 25,000 monthly active users (MAU) and INR 600 lakh annual revenue by Year 5 (Q3 2030), leveraging features like AI care tips, community forums, and a loyalty program. Built with React Native, Firebase, Razorpay, and Google APIs, CatCare ensures >99% uptime, 95% booking fulfillment, and compliance with India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP) 2023.
