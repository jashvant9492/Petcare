Product Concept Document: Cat-Only Pet Sitting Application (Bangalore, India)

Market Problem or Opportunity

Description: Cat owners in Bangalore struggle to find accessible, affordable, and reliable pet sitting services tailored to feline needs, particularly in nearby regions.

Only 10% of pet sitters in Bangalore specialize in cats, per local pet community feedback.
70% of Bangalore pet owners prioritize sitters within 5 km (local pet community feedback).


Benefits:
Lower costs: INR 250–400/visit vs. INR 1,000–1,500 for boarding.
Enhanced UX with cat-specific features (e.g., mood tracking, litter tips).
Accessibility: Hyper-local freelancer sitters in nearby areas (e.g., within 3–5 km).

Hyperscaling Consideration: 
Cloud-native AWS with geolocation APIs for hyper-local sitter matching; automated onboarding for regional expansion.
