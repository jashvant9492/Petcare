Overview
The cat-only pet sitting application in Bengaluru targets two primary user groups: pet owners and pet sitters, reflecting the two-sided marketplace model. 
Pet owners seek reliable, affordable, and cat-specific care, while pet sitters provide these services, driven by income, flexibility, and a love for animals. 
These personas, developed from market research, social media insights, and industry best practices for two-sided marketplaces, guide app design, feature prioritization, and marketing strategies to ensure a balanced platform that meets the needs of both groups.
