1. Overview
The beta test for CatCare, a mobile application for cat-only pet sitting in Bengaluru, India, is designed to validate the app’s functionality, usability, and market fit before its Q3 2025 launch.
Built with Bolt.new, Firebase, and React Native, CatCare offers a freemium model with INR 200–350/visit pricing, targeting Bengaluru’s ~340,000 cat-owning households (Statista). 
The beta test, scheduled for September 2025, involves 50 testers (25 cat owners, 25 sitters) to ensure the app meets user needs for affordability, trust, and hyper-local accessibility (85% bookings within 5 km). 
Feedback will inform final refinements, supporting the goal of 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) by Q3 2026 and INR 132 lakh revenue in Year 1.

2. Beta Planning Considerations
Testing Purpose

Why is this test required?
To validate the MVP’s core features (user registration, hyper-local booking, profiles, payments, chat) and ensure it addresses market pain points: trust (65% concern), affordability (60% prefer INR 200–350), and cat-specific care (45% demand).
To confirm usability (e.g., booking in <5 minutes) and reliability (e.g., 95% booking fulfillment) before public launch.


What goals do you hope to achieve?
Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) >60, indicating high user satisfaction.
Ensure 90% task completion rate for key actions (e.g., booking, profile setup).
