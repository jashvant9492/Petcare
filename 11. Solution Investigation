1. Market Investigation Overview
The MRD highlighted key pain points: 
trust issues (65% of owners), high costs (INR 500–1,500/visit), 
limited cat-specific care (45% demand)
availability gaps in outskirts (55% concern). 
With ~340,000 cat-owning households and a pet sitting market growing at a 16.4% CAGR, the opportunity is significant. 


2. Identification and Prioritization of Solution Candidates

To develop solution candidates, a Joint Application Design (JAD) session is recommended, involving the product team, cat owners, and potential sitters from Bangalore Cat Squad. 
The following candidates were brainstormed based on the MRD and market insights:

3. Feasibility Study
The feasibility study evaluates the mobile app with a freemium model across technical, financial, and operational dimensions.


Technical Feasibility

Question: Can the app be built using Bubble, Firebase, and Google Cloud Dialogflow?
Assessment: Yes, these platforms support:

Bubble: Rapid prototyping of user interfaces (booking, profiles).
Firebase: Backend for authentication, database, hosting.
Dialogflow: AI chatbot for user support.
React Native: Mobile app for iOS/Android.
Risks: Limited customization with low-code; performance issues at scale.
Mitigation: Use React Native for performance; monitor scalability with Firebase.



Financial Feasibility

Question: Can the app be developed within ~INR 23 lakh?
Assessment: Yes, estimated costs:

Component
Cost (INR)

Bubble (frontend)
5 lakh

Firebase (backend)
5 lakh

Dialogflow (AI)
3 lakh

React Native (app)
10 lakh

Total
23 lakh



Operational Costs: INR 15 lakh/year (hosting, marketing, support).
Risks: Underestimating marketing or sitter onboarding costs.
Mitigation: Allocate budget for targeted ads (Instagram, Facebook); leverage Bangalore Cat Squad for low-cost promotion.



Operational Feasibility

Question: Can enough sitters be recruited to meet demand?
Assessment: Feasible with:

Incentives: 15% commission, instant UPI payouts, INR 400 bonus for 15+ bookings/month.
Partnerships: Bangalore Cat Squad, pet stores (Heads Up For Tails) for recruitment.
Target: 50 sitters in Year 1, scaling to 100 by Year 2.
Risks: Sitter churn; quality concerns.
Mitigation: Rigorous vetting, ratings, cat-specific training.



Conclusion: The mobile app is technically viable, financially feasible within budget, and operationally achievable with strategic sitter recruitment.
