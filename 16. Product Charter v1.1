1. Project Description

Project Name: CatCare

Purpose:
CatCare is a mobile application designed to connect Bengaluru’s cat owners with verified, local pet sitters, offering affordable (INR 200–350/visit), trustworthy, and cat-specific pet sitting services through a freemium model. 
Launching in Q3 2025, the app targets 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) by Q3 2026 and aims to generate INR 132 lakh in Year 1 (INR 96 lakh from premium subscriptions, INR 36 lakh from booking commissions), scaling to INR 528 lakh by Year 3. 
CatCare addresses key pain points: trust issues (65% of owners), high costs (INR 500–1,500/visit), limited cat-specific care (45% demand), and availability gaps in outskirts (55% concern) within Bengaluru’s ~340,000 cat-owning households.
