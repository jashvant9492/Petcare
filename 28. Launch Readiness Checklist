Part I: Product Launch Readiness Checklist
The Launch Readiness Checklist evaluates the preparedness of CatCare, a mobile app for cat-only pet sitting in Bengaluru, India, for its October 2025 launch. Targeting 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) by Q3 2026 and INR 132 lakh revenue in Year 1, CatCare leverages a freemium model with INR 200–350/visit pricing to address Bengaluru’s ~340,000 cat-owning households (Statista). The checklist assesses readiness across beta planning, testing, roles, metrics, launch plan, functional requirements, documentation, business plan, and launch decision, ensuring alignment with the product launch plan, beta plan, and Qualify Phase RACI.

Part II: Readiness Issues and Recommendations



Readiness Issue
Recommendation



Incomplete Beta Testing: Beta test type (closed beta with 50 testers) is determined, but testing is not yet conducted (scheduled for September 2025), delaying validation of functionality and usability.
Finalize beta testing by September 14, 2025, as per beta plan. Accelerate tester recruitment (Bangalore Cat Squad, Heads Up For Tails) to meet August 31 deadline. Analyze results by September 20 to inform fixes.


Uncommitted Participants: Not all beta testing participants (e.g., 50 testers, vet clinic partners) are committed, risking insufficient feedback or partner support.
Secure commitments by August 2025 via signed agreements with testers (incentives: free premium subscription, INR 1,000 bonus) and MOUs with partners (e.g., 10 vet clinics). Confirm via Community Manager follow-ups.


Launch Plan Not Finalized: Launch plan updates (e.g., final ad creatives, event logistics) are incomplete, and approval is pending stakeholder review.
Complete launch plan updates by September 2025, including ad creatives (INR 5 lakh budget) and launch event details (October 1, 200 attendees). Obtain stakeholder approval by September 30.


Sales and Channel Assessment Pending: Sales and channel requirements are documented, but readiness assessment (e.g., partner training, flyer distribution) is not complete.
Conduct assessment by September 2025, confirming 80% partner readiness (2/3 pet stores, 8/10 clinics). Distribute flyers and train staff by August 31, per sales and channel requirements.


Customer Support Assessment Pending: Customer support requirements are documented, but readiness assessment (e.g., agent training, tool setup) is not complete.
Complete assessment by September 30, 2025, validating in-app chat, email, and FAQs during beta testing. Train 3 agents and set up Zendesk by September, per customer support requirements.


Operations Assessment Pending: Operations requirements are documented, but readiness assessment (e.g., 50 sitters, platform stability) is not complete.
Finalize assessment by September 2025, confirming 50 sitters trained and 95% booking fulfillment via beta test simulations. Ensure platform uptime >99% with Firebase monitoring, per operations requirements.


Incomplete Documentation: Product documentation (user guides, FAQs, technical docs) is not fully updated or distributed to stakeholders.
Update documentation by September 2025, including in-app FAQs, user guides, and API guides. Distribute to stakeholders (support, partners, developers) by September 30 via shared drive.


Business Plan Not Approved: Business plan updates (e.g., refined financials, market analysis) are in progress, and approval is pending.
Complete updates by September 2025, incorporating beta test results and refined revenue forecasts (INR 132 lakh Year 1). Secure sponsor approval by September 30.


Launch Decision Pending: Readiness assessments are incomplete, delaying the final launch decision.
Complete all assessments by September 30, 2025, per functional requirements. Schedule stakeholder review meeting (October 1) to approve launch, ensuring all criteria (e.g., NPS >60, 95% fulfillment) are met.


Summary
The Launch Readiness Checklist for CatCare confirms that the beta plan and success metrics are complete, but beta testing, roles, launch plan, functional assessments, documentation, business plan, and launch decision require further progress as of May 2025. Scheduled for completion by September 2025, these components will ensure the app’s readiness for its October 2025 launch, supporting 5,000 MAU, INR 132 lakh revenue, and alignment with Bengaluru’s pet sitting market (YourStory). Recommendations focus on accelerating timelines, securing commitments, and finalizing assessments to mitigate risks and achieve launch goals.
