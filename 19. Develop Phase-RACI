The Develop Phase of the CatCare project involves designing, building, testing, and preparing the mobile application for launch, targeting a Q3 2025 release.
The app, built using Bolt.new, Firebase, and React Native, offers cat-specific pet sitting services in Bengaluru, India, with a freemium model.
The following Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) matrix defines roles and responsibilities for key activities, ensuring efficient collaboration and alignment with the project’s goals of affordability (INR 200–350/visit), trust, and hyper-local accessibility (85% bookings within 5 km).

Key Activities

Define Technical Design and Architecture: Establish the app’s technical blueprint, including system architecture and data models.
Develop Code and Implement Features: Code core functionalities (e.g., user registration, hyper-local booking, profiles).
Conduct Testing: Perform unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure quality.
Perform Integration of Components: Integrate frontend, backend, and APIs (e.g., Razorpay, Google Maps).
Prepare for Deployment: Finalize staging, beta testing, and release planning.

Explanation of Roles and Responsibilities

Product Manager: 
Accountable for the overall development process, ensuring alignment with market needs (e.g., trust, affordability) and project goals (5,000 MAU by Q3 2026). 
Monitors progress, resolves blockers, and approves deliverables.

Development Team: 
Responsible for designing the app’s architecture, coding features (e.g., booking system, profiles), and integrating components. 
Consulted during testing and deployment for debugging and final checks.

Project/Program Manager:
Informed about progress, ensuring schedules, budget (~INR 23 lakh for development), and scope are maintained. 
Tracks milestones (e.g., MVP completion by August 2025).

Business Analyst: 
Consulted during design, development, and testing to ensure features meet user requirements (e.g., hyper-local booking, cat-specific care).

Product Owner: 
Consulted across all activities to prioritize features, validate user stories, and ensure the product backlog aligns with owner and sitter needs.

Quality Assurance: 
Responsible for conducting testing (unit, integration, system, UAT) to meet quality standards (e.g., 95% booking fulfillment). 
Consulted during development for test-driven approaches and integration for quality checks.

Release Manager:
Responsible for preparing the app for deployment, including staging, beta testing with 50 users, and release planning. 
Informed during development and testing to ensure release readiness.

Customers:
Consulted during user acceptance testing (UAT) in September 2025 to validate usability and functionality, ensuring the app meets owner and sitter expectations.



Notes

Agile Methodology: 
The project uses an agile approach, with the Product Owner managing the product backlog and user stories (e.g., “As an owner, I want photo updates”).

Customer Involvement: 
Customers (cat owners, sitters) are involved in UAT to provide feedback, critical for achieving an NPS >60.

Development Tools:
Bolt.new, Firebase, React Native, and Google Cloud Dialogflow are used, influencing the Development Team’s responsibilities for rapid, low-code development.

Testing Scope: 
Includes unit testing (Development Team), integration/system testing (Quality Assurance), and UAT (Customers, Quality Assurance).

Sitter Recruitment: 
Operations Lead (not listed in RACI but part of broader team) supports sitter onboarding, critical for deployment readiness.
