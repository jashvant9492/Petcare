Customer Support Launch Requirements for CatCare Pet Sitting Application
1. Overview
The Customer Support Launch Requirements document outlines the processes and resources needed to provide effective support for CatCare users (cat owners and sitters) following the app’s October 2025 launch in Bengaluru, India. CatCare, a cat-only pet sitting platform, targets 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) by Q3 2026, generating INR 132 lakh revenue in Year 1. Support will address user queries (e.g., booking issues, payments) to ensure trust and satisfaction, critical for achieving an NPS >60. This document aligns with the Qualify Phase RACI and launch plan, ensuring readiness for post-launch operations.


2. Objectives
Respond to user queries within 24 hours.
Achieve 90% query resolution rate within first contact.
Attain Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score >85% post-launch.
Handle ~500 monthly queries at launch, scaling to 2,000 by Year 3.

3. Requirements
3.1 Support Channels

In-App Chat: Real-time support via Firebase-integrated chat for immediate assistance (e.g., booking errors).
Email Support: Dedicated email (support@catcare.in) for complex issues (e.g., payment disputes).
