Market Problem or Opportunity

Description: 
Cat owners in Bangalore struggle to find reliable, affordable, and cat-specific pet sitting services. 
With ~4.5 lakh cat-owning households and a 20% YoY growth in pet adoption, demand for specialized care is high.
Existing solutions like PetBacker (INR 500–1,500/visit) and kennel-based hospital boarding (e.g., Cessna Lifeline) are costly, lack cat focus, or stress cats. 
Trust issues with unverified sitters and limited availability in outskirts exacerbate the problem. 
The global pet sitting market, valued at USD 2.69 billion in 2024, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 11.8% through 2030, offering a prime opportunity for a tech-driven, cat-only solution.

Data/Insights:
65% of cat owners cite trust and availability as top concerns (Facebook groups, Justdial reviews).
70% prefer in-home visits over boarding (PetBacker, Snouters reviews).
Bengaluru pet spending averages INR 3,000/month (Supertails, 2023).
~30% of cat owners travel 4+ times/year, needing sitting services (Google Trends, social media).

Benefits:
Affordability: INR 200–350/visit, undercutting competitors.
Cat-Specific Care: Tailored services (litter management, behavioral care).
Hyper-Local Accessibility: 85% bookings within 5 km via Google Maps API.
Trust: Rigorous sitter vetting, premium photo/video updates.
Freemium Model: Free basic booking with per-visit fees; premium features (INR 800/month) drive growth and revenue.

Cost-Saving Consideration: 
Low-code platforms (Bubble, Firebase) minimize development costs (~INR 23 lakh), enabling rapid market entry.
