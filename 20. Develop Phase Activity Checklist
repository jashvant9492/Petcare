The Develop Phase Activity Checklist for the CatCare mobile application, a cat-only pet sitting platform for Bengaluru, India, ensures all critical tasks are completed to deliver a freemium model app by October 2025. 
The checklist organizes activities into four groups—Product Implementation, Product Requirements Refinement, Product Verification Activities, and Release and Configuration Management—to support the development of features like hyper-local booking, secure payments, and real-time updates. 
Each activity includes objectives to clarify its purpose and an “Accomplished” status to track progress, aligning with the project’s goals of affordability (INR 200–350/visit), trust, and achieving 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) by Q3 2026.

Develop Phase Product Development Activities
Product Implementation
Define the lead role to manage the end-to-end product development process
Assign Product Manager as lead to oversee development, coordinate teams, and ensure alignment with market needs (e.g., cat-specific care, affordability).

Product Implementation
Identify key stakeholders required in the development phase
Identify stakeholders (e.g., Product Manager, Development Team, Bangalore Cat Squad, pet store partners) and define their roles per the RACI matrix.

Product Implementation
Complete and coordinate a Develop Phase RACI
Develop and share RACI matrix to clarify Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed roles for activities like coding and testing.

Product Implementation
Add detail to the initial Project Plan completed in the Plan phase
Update project plan with detailed schedules, resource allocations, and milestones (e.g., MVP completion by August 2025).

Product Implementation
Determine appropriate lifecycle for product development
Confirm agile methodology with iterative sprints, prioritizing user stories for features like booking and profiles.

Product Implementation
Develop required prototypes and mock-ups (As applicable)
Create Bolt.new prototype for core features (registration, search, booking) and mock-ups for UI/UX, validated with 10–15 users.

Product Implementation
Plan hand off to manufacturing and operations
Define process for handing off app to operations team for sitter onboarding and customer support post-launch.

Product Implementation
Design physical packaging
Not applicable (digital app).

Product Implementation
Address issues (As applicable)
Establish process to track and resolve development issues (e.g., bugs, delays) via bi-weekly team meetings.


Product Requirements Refinement
Review "good enough scenario." Update Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Ensure PRD reflects minimum viable product (MVP) scope (e.g., booking, payments) and user needs, updating based on prototype feedback.
N

Review PRD for missing requirements or lack of detail
Identify gaps in PRD (e.g., missing security protocols) and add specifics (e.g., <3-second load time).
N

Review PRD and clarify vague requirements
Refine ambiguous requirements (e.g., “user-friendly interface” to “complete booking in <5 minutes”).
N

Identify and remedy implementation limitations
Address technical constraints (e.g., Bolt.new scalability) by selecting Firebase for backend support.
N



Product Verification Activities
Update product test strategy
Develop comprehensive test strategy covering unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT) for quality assurance.
N

Define minimum test acceptance levels
Set acceptance criteria (e.g., 95% booking fulfillment, <1% payment errors) for test completion.
N

Define compliance requirements
Ensure compliance with data privacy (e.g., India’s DPDP Act) and payment security (Razorpay PCI DSS).
N

Release product to supporting operational function
Transfer app to operations team for post-launch support (e.g., sitter management, customer queries).
N



Release and Configuration Management
Identify version control process
Implement Git-based version control (e.g., GitHub) for code management and feature tracking.
N

Develop formal change management process
Establish process for reviewing and approving changes to requirements or scope, managed by Product Manager.
N

Verify development and testing configurations and environments
Confirm development (Bolt.new, Firebase) and testing environments (e.g., staging server) are correctly configured.
N

Manage overall product build process
Oversee build pipeline, ensuring integration of frontend, backend, and APIs (e.g., Google Maps, Razorpay).
N

Validate final components to include packaging for distribution or operations
Verify app components (e.g., APK for Google Play) and operational readiness (e.g., sitter onboarding).
N

Ensure all required process steps are completed
Confirm all development, testing, and release steps are completed per checklist before launch.
N

Track defects, issues, and develop remediation plan
Use issue tracking (e.g., Jira) to log defects, prioritize fixes, and plan remediation during testing.
N

Complete product release checklist—release product
Finalize release checklist (e.g., beta test results, store approvals) and deploy app to Google Play/App Store.
N




Notes

Context:
The checklist is tailored for CatCare, a mobile app built with Bolt.new, Firebase, React Native, and Google Cloud Dialogflow, targeting Bengaluru’s ~340,000 cat-owning households (Statista).

Agile Approach: 
The agile methodology influences activities like iterative prototyping and user story prioritization, with the Product Owner managing the backlog.

Stakeholder Involvement: 
Key stakeholders (e.g., Bangalore Cat Squad, pet store partners like Heads Up For Tails) are consulted for feedback during prototyping and UAT.

Testing Focus: 
Emphasis on usability (e.g., <5-minute booking) and reliability (e.g., 95% booking fulfillment) to achieve NPS >60.

Digital Product: 
Physical packaging is not applicable, as CatCare is a mobile app distributed via app stores.

Timeline:
Activities are planned for July–October 2025, with prototyping in July, development in July–August, testing in September, and release in October.

Budget Alignment: 
Development costs (INR 23 lakh) and launch marketing (INR 8 lakh) guide resource allocation for activities like prototyping and testing.



This checklist ensures all Develop Phase activities are systematically addressed, facilitating the successful delivery of the CatCare MVP by Q3 2025. It supports the project’s financial goals (INR 132 lakh revenue in Year 1) and market objectives (5,000 MAU by Q3 2026).
