1. Overview
The End-of-Life (EOL) Plan for CatCare, a mobile application for cat-only pet sitting in Bengaluru, India, provides a structured process for retiring the product if it fails to meet performance targets post-launch in October 2025. Targeting 5,000 monthly active users (MAU) and INR 132 lakh revenue in Year 1, CatCare operates in Bengaluru’s ~340,000 cat-owning household market (Statista), part of India’s USD 253.6 million pet sitting market by 2030 (Grand View Research). The plan outlines EOL evaluation triggers—<2,500 MAU by Q3 2026 or <INR 66 lakh revenue in Year 1—with a potential retirement decision by Q1 2027. It addresses product identification, rationale, retirement strategy, migration, communications, internal/external impacts, costs, and risks, ensuring minimal disruption and preserving brand reputation.


2. EOL Triggers and Targets
Performance Triggers:
MAU: <2,500 MAU by Q3 2026 (50% of 5,000 target, per launch plan).
Revenue: <INR 66 lakh in Year 1 (50% of INR 132 lakh target, INR 96 lakh from premium, INR 36 lakh from bookings).
NPS: <60 by Q3 2026, indicating poor user satisfaction (vs. >70 target).
Competitive Pressure: Loss of >30% market share to competitors like PetBacker or new entrants by Q4 2026.


Evaluation Timeline:
Q3 2026: Assess MAU, revenue, and NPS via Firebase Analytics and financial reports.
Q4 2026: Conduct stakeholder review; decide on remediation (e.g., feature pivot) or EOL initiation.
Q1 2027: Finalize EOL decision and execute retirement if targets unmet.

Comments



Product Identification
Y
Scope: CatCare mobile app (iOS/Android), including Firebase backend, Razorpay payment integration, and partnerships (e.g., Heads Up For Tails, Bangalore Cat Squad).

Action: Document rationale in Q4 2026 stakeholder report, citing metrics and market challenges (e.g., 30% lower pricing unsustainable).


Retirement Strategy
Y
Strategy: Phased shutdown over 3 months (Q1 2027): halt new user registrations (January), stop bookings (February), deactivate app (March). Action: Develop strategy by Q4 2026, outlining timeline, user migration, and data deletion per India’s DPDP Act 2023.


Proposed Migration Plan
Y
Plan: Migrate users to competitors (e.g., PetBacker) with INR 200 credit for first booking; refund premium subscriptions; export sitter profiles to partner platforms. Action: Create migration guide by Q4 2026, partnering with 2–3 platforms for seamless transition.


Communications Management Planning
Y
Plan: Develop a Communications Management Plan for users, sitters, partners, and staff, using email, in-app notifications, and press releases. Action: Draft plan by Q4 2026, announcing EOL in January 2027 with FAQs and support contacts.


Internal Impact Analysis
Y
Impact: Affects 5 support agents, 3 developers, and 2 marketing staff; potential layoffs or reassignment. Action: Conduct analysis by Q4 2026, offering severance (INR 2 lakh total) or redeployment to new xAI projects.

Analysis: Estimate shutdown costs (INR 5 lakh, including refunds, severance, and server deactivation) vs. continued operation losses (INR 50 lakh/year). Action: Complete cost/benefit analysis by Q4 2026, justifying EOL financially.


Risk Analysis
Y
Risks: User backlash, legal issues (DPDP compliance), partner distrust. Action: Conduct risk analysis by Q4 2026, developing mitigation plans (e.g., transparent communication, data deletion protocols).
