Industry Growth: Bengaluru’s pet sitting market is part of India’s USD 115.7 million pet industry, growing at a 16.4% CAGR through 2030 (Grand View Research).
Target Market: ~340,000 cat-owning households in Bengaluru, driven by urban pet adoption trends and pet-friendly culture (Statista).

Competitive Landscape:
PetBacker: INR 500–1,500/visit, 20% commission, broad pet focus.
Crazycatlife: INR 300–600, cat-specific but limited to 8 cats, no app.
Vet clinics: INR 500–1,000/day for boarding, less preferred due to cat stress.

Consumer Trends: 65% of cat owners cite trust issues, 60% seek affordable pricing (INR 200–350/visit), and 45% demand cat-specific care (Pet Pals Bengaluru).

2. Opportunity

Market Pain Points:

Market Gap: No scalable, affordable, cat-only pet sitting app exists in Bengaluru, creating an opportunity for CatCare to capture market share.
Revenue Potential: Targeting ~340,000 households, CatCare can achieve 5,000 MAU by Q3 2026 (1.5% penetration), generating INR 132 lakh in Year 1 and INR 528 lakh by Year 3.
